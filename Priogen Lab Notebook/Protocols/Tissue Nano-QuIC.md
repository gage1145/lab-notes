## Equipment
- Biosafety cabinet
- BMG Plate Reader
- PCR Hood
- Vortex
## Consumables
- Priogen RT-QuIC kit buffer A
- MNPROtein aliquots
- 10% (w:v) tissue homogenate
- Sample dilution buffer (No N$_2$)
- 96-well plate
- Plate tape
- 10mL Tube
## Protocol
### Make Master Mix
1. In a 10mL tube, add the reagents in order and vortex:
	- 4707μL diH2O
	- 1460 μL Buffer A
	- 1250 μL Buffer B
	- 1250 μL Buffer C
	- Total volume will equal ∼8.7mL.
2. Add 1333μL of MNPROtein™ (lot number 1000) to the same 10 mL
tube and mix gently by inversion.
	- Total volume will equal 10 mL
### Prepare Sample Dilutions
1. Remove tissue homogenate from freezer and allow to thaw.
	- 10% (w:v) tissue homogenates are considered to be a dilution of 10$^{−1}$.
2. Dilute the sample to at least 10$^{−2}$.
	- Brain samples will need another 10-fold dilution to be detected.
	- Brain samples should be tested at 10$^{−3}$ and 10$^{−4}$.
### Plate Setup
1. Pipet 98 μL of master mix into each well of the microplate.
2. Pipet 2 μL of the tissue dilution to each well.
3. Seal the plate with plate tape before running.
	- 4 replicates, 45°C, 48 hr
