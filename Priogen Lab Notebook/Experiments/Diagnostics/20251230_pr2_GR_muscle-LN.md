## Purpose

## Design
### Equipment
- Biosafety cabinet
- BMG Plate Reader
- PCR Hood
- Vortex
### Consumables
- Priogen RT-QuIC kit buffer A
- Nanoparticle suspension
- MNPROtein aliquots
- 10% (w:v) tissue homogenate
- Sample dilution buffer (No N$_2$)
- 96-well plate
- Plate tape
- 10mL Tube
### Protocol
#### Make Master Mix
1. In a 10mL tube, add the reagents in order and vortex:
	- 4707μL diH2O
	- 1460μL Buffer A
	- 2500μL Nanoparticles
	- Total volume will equal ∼8.7mL.
2. Add 1333μL of MNPROtein™ (lot number 1000) to the same 10 mL
tube and mix gently by inversion.
	- Total volume will equal 10 mL
#### Prepare Sample Dilutions
1. Remove tissue homogenate from freezer.
2. Resuspend muscle pellets in 200 μL of Sample dilution buffer.
	- This is considered a 10$^{−1}$ dilution
#### Plate Setup
1. Pipet 98 μL of master mix into each well of the microplate.
2. Pipet 2 μL of the tissue dilution to each well.
3. Seal the plate with plate tape before running.
	- 4 replicates, 45°C, 48 hr
