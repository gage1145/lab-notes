## Purpose

I'm pretty sure the last experiment was inconclusive. Not enough time was given to determine if the machine was overheating. I started earlier today, to give it more time to reach temp.

## Design

No changes from the last experiment. Just giving it more time.

Experiment started at 11:08am.

## Results

Roxy stopped the experiment at 2:07. Temp was at 48.7$\textdegree$C. I think I'll just have to wait for Peter to return so he can take a look at it. He'll have a better understanding of why it's overheating.
