## Purpose

I'm pretty sure the last experiment was inconclusive. Not enough time was given to determine if the machine was overheating. I started earlier today, to give it more time to reach temp.

## Design

No changes from the last experiment. Just giving it more time.

Experiment started at 11:08am.

## Results
