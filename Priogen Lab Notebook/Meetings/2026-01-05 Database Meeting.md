## Overview
1. I need to add logic not to overwrite fields with null if a tech is updating info (esp if that sample already has results)
2. Add a button for diagnosis.
3. Maybe incorporate AUC for QC metrics.
4. Maybe add a Results table for samples with multiple runs.
	1. I think this is definitely what needs to be done.
	2. Maybe call it Diagnoses.
5. Can I have the sample table be organized more like [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cgE6XdzcumlAfetppZW2UcuZ0JQ81PogwrFGOIViS9E/edit?gid=0#gid=0)?
6. Add a "Retest Needed" field for a sample.
7. Update database SOPs.
