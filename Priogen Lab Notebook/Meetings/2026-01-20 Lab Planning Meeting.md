association: Priogen
summary: The team planned current and upcoming lab work, including setting up a plate that day and starting another later in the week. Updates from last week’s R&D LN plates showed strong positive controls, with potential false seeding in the negative control. Operational needs included preparing a new batch of Buffer A and evaluating new homogenizers for muscle samples. PriLIMS updates focused on improving sample-level reporting, automating updates from orders, and refining QC logic based on tissue type and sample category.

## Overview
1. Setting up a plate today.

		2. The neg ctrl maybe is false seeding
3. Start another plate sometime this week
4. Next batch of buffer A needed soon
5. RnD
	1. Tried new homogenizers on muscle
		1. Can get 100mg with 900mL but it is a tight fit.
6. PriLIMS
	1. Add reporting to sample level
	2. Auto update from order level
	3. Change perc_cross based on tissue type.
