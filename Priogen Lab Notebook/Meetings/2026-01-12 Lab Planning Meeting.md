association: Priogen
summary: The team reviewed recent lab activities, including LN dilution plates, Micro-QuIC QC runs, and waste pickups, with plans to rerun a negative control plate and consider RT-QuIC testing. This week’s work includes running two additional plates, while the UPenn shipment remains on hold pending nanoparticle delivery. R&D updates highlighted a successful PrioVision run that now needs image analysis, along with continued evaluation of Micro-QuIC reagent freezing constraints. PriLIMS updates were completed to improve diagnosis visibility and automate QC handling when controls fail.

## Overview
1. Stericycle pickups on Monday
2. 2 LN dilution plates last week
	1. Maybe try running RT-QuIC?
	2. Rerun neg plate (Neg ctrl was bad)
3. Micro-QuIC QC plate running
	1. Needs analysis
4. This Week
	1. 1 plate on Monday with muscle and LNs
	2. Another on Friday
5. UPenn shipment on hold until nanoparticles come in.
6. Micro-QuIC frozen QC
	1. Cannot freeze rPrP with the MM.
	2. Try freezing without water?
7. PrioVision
	1. RnD run finished; was successful
	2. Need to do image analysis
8. PriLIMS
