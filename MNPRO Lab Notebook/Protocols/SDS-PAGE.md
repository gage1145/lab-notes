## Equipment
- Bio-Rad electrophoresis apparatus
- Shaking incubator
- Refrigerated shaker
## Consumables
- SDS-PAGE running buffer
- 6X loading dye
- Protein ladder
- Protein sample
- Polyacrylamide gel
- diH$_2$O
- Fixing solution
	- 50% methanol
	- 10% acetic acid
## Protocol
1. Thaw your samples on ice.
2. To a PCR tube add 1 $\textmu$L of 6X loading dye for every 5 $\textmu$L of sample.
3. Add an appropriate amount of sample to the PCR tube.
4. Boil the tubes on a thermal cycler at 99°C for 5 min using the heated lid at 100°C to prevent condensation.
5. Meanwhile, set up the gel rig. If only running one gel, use the buffer dam on the opposite side.
	1. Make sure the dam and gel are tightly sealed to the gasket.
6. Pour in 1X running buffer to the appropriate line in the basin.
7. Eject any remaining storage buffer in the wells by pipetting 200 $\textmu$L of running buffer.
8. Load 2 $\textmu$L of ladder and up to 15 $\textmu$L of boiled sample.
9. Run at 175 V for ~1 hr. until the dye front almost runs out of the bottom of the gel.
10. Remove the gel and briefly soak in water to remove any extra running buffer.
11. Store the gel in fixing solution for 1 hr. with gentle agitation.
