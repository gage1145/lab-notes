## Purpose

These samples will be submitted to mass spec for a targeted assay. My goal is for this to be both quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative in that I will be submitting a positive sample with a known SD50 (sample 141234) for reference. Qualitative in that I want to know if we can even detect the target within the soil extracts.

## Design
- Samples will be submitted as gel bands.
- Gel bands will need to be de-stained for silver.
- Samples will need to be trypsin digested.
