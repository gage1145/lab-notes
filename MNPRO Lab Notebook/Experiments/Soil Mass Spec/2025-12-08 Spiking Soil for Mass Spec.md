## Purpose

These soils will be used as positive controls for mass spec. They are confirmed CWD-negative soils that will be spiked with CWD-positive material (sample 141234; Stuart's seed).

## Samples

| Sample |     Type      |
|:------:|:-------------:|
|   A1   |     Soil      |
|   H1   |     Soil      |
|   H2   |     Soil      |
| 141234 | Positive seed |

## Design

See protocol [[Spiking Soil with Prions]]. Briefly, 500mg soil is spiked with 500$\textmu$L seed (diluted 100-fold in water).

Samples were removed from the vacufuge and were split into 200 $\textmu$L portions in 1.5mL tubes. Samples were stored at -80$\textdegree$C on 12-09-2025.

## Results

Samples were stored at -80$\textdegree$C in Ren Vhar.
