## Purpose

In order to get accurate results with mass spec, the team informed me that I need to try to get the protein concentrations normalized. This means bringing all samples to the same concentration.

## Design
1. Resuspend pellet in 100$\textmu$L water.
2. Measure the concentrations using the Qubit protein assay.
## Results

| ----------- | ------------- | ------ | ------------- |
