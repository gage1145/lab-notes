## Equipment
- Vacuum centrifuge
- Biosafety Cabinet
- Tabletop centrifuge
- Scale
## Consumables
- diH$_2$O
- Prion sample
- 500 mg soil sample (preferably dried)
- 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
- Disposable scoopula
- Weigh boats
## Protocol
1. Make a 100-fold dilution of your prion seed in the diH$_2$O.
	1. E.g. 35 $\textmu$L seed in 3.5 mL water
2. Weigh out 500 mg of soil and add to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.
3. Add 500 $\textmu$L of the prion diluent to the soil.
4. Briefly vortex to incorporate.
5. Dry in the vacuum centrifuge overnight, 45$\textdegree$C.
	1. Make sure to open the tubes before starting the vacuum, otherwise, the liquid won't evaporate.
